| **AWS CFT**                  | AWS CloudFormation Templates. A template-based service on AWS used to **create, manage, and update cloud infrastructure** on AWS. Implements the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Takes declarative and versioned templates (YAML or JSON) from the user and converts them into AWS API calls. Only targets AWS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Helps in **automating the creation of AWS resources and entire infrastructure stacks**. A **service on AWS** itself. Converts user-friendly template definitions into the necessary API calls for AWS. **Preferred tool for creating actual resources or huge stacks** compared to AWS CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)** | A principle where you write code (or templates) to create infrastructure. Tools that follow this principle (like CFT, Terraform) act as a **middleman between the user and cloud provider(s)**. Users submit declarative and versioned templates (e.g., YAML, JSON) to the tool. The tool translates these templates into API calls that the cloud provider understands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Automates infrastructure creation and management** programmatically. Allows users to manage infrastructure without needing to know how to make direct API calls. Tools implement the **principles of declarative and versioned templates**. **CFT implements this principle**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **AWS CLI**                  | AWS Command Line Interface [from conversation history]. A tool that can be used to manage and create infrastructure on AWS. Does not implement the principles of IaC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Very important for quick, short actions** or simple scripts. Useful for getting details about AWS resources quickly (e.g., listing S3 buckets). In scenarios requiring rapid simple tasks, CLI is preferred over writing and executing a CFT template. **Not ideal for creating complicated stacks or combinations of resources**.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **API Calls**                | The programmatic language understood by cloud providers (like AWS) for creating, deleting, and managing resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | IaC tools like CFT and Terraform **convert user templates/commands into API calls** to interact with the cloud provider. Users interact with the IaC tool, not directly with the API calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Declarative Template**     | A key principle of IaC. Describes the desired state of the infrastructure ("what you see is what you have"). When you look at a declarative template, you should understand exactly what resources will be created or are available on the cloud provider. CFT templates are declarative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Simplifies understanding of the infrastructure** by reading the template. Makes **code review and auditing easy**. Users define *what* they want, and the IaC tool figures out *how* to achieve that state [implied by "what you see is what you have"].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Versioned Template**       | A key principle of IaC. Templates can be stored in version control systems (like Git) or storage services (like S3). Allows tracking changes over time and reverting to previous versions. AWS automatically saves CFT templates in a random S3 bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Provides a history of infrastructure changes**. **Enables collaboration** and easier management of infrastructure configurations within a team. Helps maintain consistency and track modifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **CFT Stacks**               | A concept within the AWS CloudFormation service. When you write a CFT template, you **submit it to a stack**. The stack acts as the entity that implements the template and manages the resources defined within it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Manages a collection of related AWS resources as a single unit** [implied by "huge tags" and "group of resource"]. Allows creating, updating, and deleting a set of resources together by managing the stack. Can be initiated via the AWS UI or CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **CFT Structure/Components** | The predefined format and sections within a CFT template (YAML or JSON). Includes optional sections like Version, Description, Metadata, Parameters, Rules, Mappings, Conditions, and Outputs, and a **mandatory Resources section**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Provides a **standardized way to define infrastructure** as code. The **Resources section is the most important and only mandatory part**, defining the specific AWS resources to be created (e.g., `AWS::EC2::Instance`, `AWS::S3::Bucket`). Optional sections like Parameters, Rules, and Outputs add **flexibility, control, and useful information**. Helps teams understand and work with templates efficiently.                                                                                    |
| **CFT Template Format (YAML vs. JSON)** | CloudFormation templates can be written in either YAML or JSON format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **YAML is generally preferred and recommended** due to better readability (indentation-based like Python), support for commenting, and wider use in the DevOps world (Kubernetes, Ansible). JSON is also supported but lacks commenting and can be harder to read due to brackets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **CFT Drift Detection**      | A feature of AWS CloudFormation that allows checking if the actual configuration of resources in a stack has drifted (changed) from the configuration defined in the original CFT template.
