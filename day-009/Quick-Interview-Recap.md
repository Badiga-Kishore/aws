**AWS S3 Quick Interview Recap**

| Concept | Description | Key Detail/Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What is S3?** | Amazon S3 stands for **Simple Storage Service**. It is a **storage service** provided by AWS. | It is one of the most **easy services to learn** on AWS. Many people start their AWS journey with S3 because it's simple to understand and execute. |
| **Purpose** | S3 solves the very common problem of **storage** for organizations. | Organizations deal with large amounts of data like heavy databases, continuous backups, application logs, dashboards, chats, CSV files, and Excel sheets. S3 provides a solution for where organizations can save all these things, especially when moving to the public cloud. |
| **Key Characteristics** | S3 possesses five important characteristics. | These are **highly scalable, highly available, security, cost efficiency, and performance**. These characteristics are major factors behind S3's popularity. |
| **Reliability & Durability** | How robust S3 is against data loss. | S3 is **99.999999999% (Eleven Nines)** reliable and durable. If you upload one billion objects over 100 years, you can expect **only one object to potentially be lost**. This is achieved by creating **multiple replicas** of objects across different Availability Zones and Data Centers within a region. Your data is almost guaranteed to never get deleted. |
| **Availability** | How often the data stored in S3 is accessible. | S3 Standard storage class offers **99.9% availability**. |
| **Scalability** | The ability of S3 to handle vast and growing amounts of data. | S3 is **highly scalable**. There is **no restriction on the amount of data** that can be stored in an S3 bucket. You can keep uploading as much data as required, and AWS S3 will not restrict you. |
| **Objects & Buckets** | The fundamental components of S3 storage. | A **Bucket** is what you create in the S3 service, acting as a container for your data. An **Object** is anything you store inside a bucket, such as pictures, videos, files, folders, Excel sheets, reports, application logs, database dumps, configuration files, etc.. **Each object cannot be more than 5 TB** in size, but you can store multiple objects. |
| **Bucket Naming** | The rules for naming an S3 bucket. | S3 bucket names **must be globally unique** across all AWS accounts. This is because anything uploaded to S3 can be globally accessible. DevOps engineers often use a naming standard to ensure uniqueness. |
| **Regional Scope** | Although content is globally accessible, buckets are tied to a specific AWS region. | S3 buckets are **scoped in a region**, similar to EC2 instances. You select a region when creating a bucket. Choosing a region nearer to the users can result in **less latency**. |
| **Global Accessibility** | How data stored in S3 can be reached from anywhere. | Content put on S3 is **globally accessible**. Objects can be accessed using the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol** via a URL. You can share the URL and grant permissions for access. |
| **Public Access Block** | A security feature to prevent accidental public exposure of data. | By default, **Public Access is blocked** for new buckets. This is highly recommended to keep enabled, especially for sensitive data. You must **disable this block** if you intend to host a public static website. |
| **Security Features** | Mechanisms to secure data stored in S3. | S3 offers various security options including **encryption** (at rest and in transit), Access Control Lists (ACLs), **Bucket Policies** to restrict permissions, Object Locking, and **Access Logging** to monitor who accesses buckets. These allow fine-grained control over who can access your data. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | How the cost of using S3 compares to other storage options. | AWS S3 is considered **very cheap and cost-effective**. The cost depends on the **storage class** selected. Hosting a static website on S3 can be very cheap compared to other platforms. |
| **Storage Classes** | Different options for storing data based on access frequency and cost requirements. | S3 offers **multiple storage classes** (e.g., Standard, Standard-IA, Glacier, Deep Archive). The choice depends on whether you prioritize **cost effectiveness or access time**. Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest but has the longest retrieval time (12-48 hours). |
| **Performance** | The speed at which data can be uploaded to and downloaded from S3. | S3 offers good performance. Using a bucket in a nearby region reduces latency. S3 supports **Multi-Part Uploads**, which helps upload large files efficiently and can retry parts if there are interruptions. |
| **Versioning** | A feature that allows keeping multiple versions of an object. | S3 supports **versioning**. When enabled on a bucket, S3 keeps a copy of the previous version whenever an object is modified or deleted. This allows you to **retrieve old versions** of objects. Versioning can be combined with storage classes and lifecycle policies for cost management (e.g., moving old versions to cheaper storage or deleting them). |
| **Static Website Hosting** | Using an S3 bucket to host a static website. | S3 can host static websites because its content is globally accessible. This requires enabling the static website hosting option on the bucket properties, specifying an index document (like `index.html`), disabling the 'Block All Public Access' setting, and adding a **bucket policy** to allow public `s3:GetObject` permissions. It is a **cheap solution** for hosting static sites. **CORS** might need to be enabled for JavaScript making external API calls. |
| **Bucket Policies** | JSON documents used to grant or deny permissions for accessing S3 buckets and their objects at the bucket level. | Bucket policies are a crucial part of S3 **permissions**. They allow you to control access even for users who might have broad S3 permissions via IAM. For example, you can use a bucket policy to **restrict access for everyone except the bucket owner**. You can use a policy generator to help write the JSON. This is an important responsibility for devops engineers. |
